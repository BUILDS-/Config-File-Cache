Hugh is pretty awesome. Now with Gentoo!

Things I have here:

xmonad.hs -- for XMonad

.xmobarrc -- for xmobar (no dzen here yet)

.xinitrc -- Runs when I start X

For you gentoo-folk out there, if you're curious about the administration of
my system:

/etc/make.conf
/etc/portage/package.use
/etc/portage/package.accept_keywords
/etc/portage/package.license
