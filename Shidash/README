These are organized by computer.

Kurapica (my laptop):

.xinitrc -- Similar to my .xsession on Kamina.

.xmobarrc -- xmobar config file for xmonad. The primary difference from the one on Kamina is that it has two processors instead of four.

xmonad.hs -- Config file for xmonad. This is almost exactly the same as the one on Kamina.


Kamina (my desktop and server):

.xsession -- The script that runs when I log into Ubuntu.

.xmobarrc -- xmobar config file for xmonad.

xmonad.hs -- Config file for xmonad.

.offlineimap -- My offlineimap config file for use with sup.
