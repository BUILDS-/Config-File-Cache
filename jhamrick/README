.bashrc -- colors and aliases and paths and things

.devscripts -- default configuration for building debian packages

.emacs -- emacs configuration; has a lot of nice python and
          autocomplete stuff in it

.emacs.d -- includes plugins and stuff for emacs

.gitconfig -- default git configuration; includes colors, aliases,
              editor, name, and email

.gitignore -- default ignore file; git will ignore all files matching
              the regexes in this file

.signature -- email signature, used by sup

.ssh/config -- ssh configuration for servers I commonly use

.stalonetray -- configuration for stalonetray; good for xmonad without
                gnome (I don't use it anymore, though)

.xinitrc/.xsession/.xprofile -- these files supposedly get run when X
                starts; you can use them to start programs when you
                start xmonad and you don't have gnome.  Not sure how
                well they work anymore, though, as I haven't used them
                in a while

.xmonad/xmonad.hs -- xmonad configuration
