Pearson.  It was in a survey class taught by Dr. Penny Bryden, and she was telling the story of how Pearson came to earn the nickname, "Mike."  I didn't expect to be laughing in History class, but there you have it.  I used Bryden's name a few comics back when I needed a fill-in for a teacher's name, and I believe the memory of Pearson came with it (she later had a big poster on her door with his big head on it, a gift from CBC's "the Greatest Canadian" series I think).  I was lucky to have her as a prof, I say in all earnestness that her lectures had a part in how I think about history and approach it will an enthusiastic humor.  May we all be so lucky as to be inspired by gifted educators.  \u000a\u000a<br /><br /><br />\u000a\u000aI find reading about Pearson to be incredibly fascinating, it was a time of fascinating leaders - Diefenbaker, Pearson, Trudeau, and maybe you've heard of some Kennedy man on the other side of the border.  Perhaps what's most interesting about him is that there is no one word to describe him as there seems to be for others, no easy summary.  He's a puzzle.  He gave a lot to Canada which we - correctly or not - like to claim as proof of some national character, and yet he was full of paradoxes.  And he's an intriguing study in leadership and character, especially in between the leaders that flanked him.\u000a\u000a<br /><br />\u000a\u000aI really enjoyed <a href="http://www.suezcrisis.ca/">this website on Pearson's role in the Suez Crisis</a>, his most well known diplomatic affair.\u000a\u000a<br /><br />\u000a\u000aI also read this very excellent collection of essays, called <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=mRxi_ig6_IgC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false"><i>Pearson: the Unlikely Gladiator</i></a> - which has quite an extensive preview on google books.

I started to think recently of another Christmas, one much later, and I thought I'd share it with you.\u000a\u000a<br /><br />\u000aIt's a place that's hard to describe for anyone who hasn't been.  For a little visual context, where I was looked like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8NbtZFL82g&feature=related">this</a>.\u000a\u000a<br /><br />\u000aI hope you have a good holiday season, my friends.\u000a\u000a<br /><br />\u000aFor a little cheer, why not download this <a href="http://www.thelineofbestfit.com/2010/12/download-ho-ho-ho-canada-deux/">wonderful collection of songs</a> by some very talented Canadian artists?  Some friends of mine included!  You'll love it.

It was about WWII movies, perhaps in the future, I will return to it.\u000a<br /><br />\u000aI moved to New York in September and am really enjoying it.  I'd like to take the opportunity to introduce you, if you aren't familiar, to some of the wonderful friends I've come to know here.  We will start with my studio mates, they were kind enough to give me a home for my desk and my mess that goes on top of it. \u000a<br /><br />\u000a\u000a<a href="http://www.fartparty.org/">Julia Wertz</a>: her new book, <i>Drinking at the Movies</i>, just came out to rave reviews.  I've read it already so I know why.  You may want to look into it.\u000a<br /><br />\u000a<a href="http://lisahanawalt.com/">Lisa Hanawalt</a>: <i>Her</i> new book also just came out!  <i>I Want You #2</i>, a follow up to (you guessed it) <i>I Want You #1</i>.  Her drawings mesmerize me, make me laugh, and make me jealous.  \u000a<br /><br />\u000a<a href="http://domitille-collardey.com/">Domitille Collardey</a>: You can't look at Domitille's drawings and not have your pants charmed off.  Have you looked at them yet? Check your pants, they're gone.\u000a<br /><br />\u000a<a href="http://www.smallnoises.com/">Sarah Glidden</a>: My first exciting New York Event was the release party for Sarah's <i>How to Understand Israel in 60 Days or Less</i>.  It's a powerfully good book.  Sarah is in the Middle East as we speak, working on another one.\u000a<br /><br />\u000a<a href="http://www.metromonster.com/">Karen Sneider</a>: Is Karen the funniest person I have met since I came to this city?  I really think so.  She used to be a comedian, after all.  The New Yorker needs to buy all of her cartoons, forever.\u000a\u000a<br /><br />\u000aI'm lucky to have a space with these talented ladies!  I tell ya.  But there is more!\u000a<br /><br />\u000a\u000a<a href="http://gabriellebell.com/">Gabrielle Bell</a>: yes, <i>the</i> Gabrielle Bell.  I don't need to introduce her really, I'm just telling you I know her, now I can feel cool and famous.\u000a<br /><br />\u000a<a href="http://www.gabbysplayhouse.com/">Gabby Schulz</a>: Gabby has mostly written under the pen name Ken Dahl, so you'll have to look that one up for books, and please please do.  His book <i>Monsters</i> was far and away the best I've read all year.\u000a<br /><br />\u000a<a href="http://sally-bloodbath.livejournal.com/">Sally Bloodbath</a>: Sally is my good friend of many years, and she makes some of my favourite comics.  You'd love comics more if you could listen to Sally talk about them, she has taught me many things.  That girl needs a real website though!\u000a<br /><br />\u000a<a href="http://lizbaillie.com/">Liz Baillie</a>: I first noticed Liz because she dressed so sharp at comic shows.  She makes a sharp comic too.  I've linked to it on here before, would I lie to you?\u000a<br /><br />\u000a<a href="http://www.wiegle.com/">Matt Wiegel</a>: Matt is the kind of cartoonist who is so nice, so talented and so hard working that I should probably be ashamed of myself around him.  \u000a<br /><br />\u000a<a href="http://lizzhickey.com/">Lizz Hickey</a>: I saw Lizz Hickey do a comic reading at SPX and I have never laughed so hard before or since, I'm pretty sure.  I love her comics more than I love maple syrup and this is coming from a Canadian.\u000a<br /><br />\u000a<a href="http://robin.utsib.net/">Robin Enrico</a>: Robin was always one of those friendly faces I was happy to see at comic shows.  But now we live in the same city!  So I see his friendly face more often.  Plus: he teaches comics!\u000a<br /><br />\u000a<a href="http://toot.mkreed.com/">MK Reed</a>: I think MK Reed is a name you are going to be hearing more of in the future, as she always seems to have several projects on the go.  It's intimidating.\u000a<br /><br />\u000a<a href="http://www.adamconover.net/">Adam Conover</a>: Surprise!  Not a comics artist!  But a comedian that you will love.  There are some new performance clips of him up on that blog, time for you to go spend some time watching them.\u000a<br /><br />\u000a<a href="http://www.derekvangieson.com/">Derek Van Gieson</a>: I first saw Derek's work when the old New Yorker cartoonists were cooing over a portfolio he brought in.  No wonder!  What beautiful drawings.  He also cooks a great Thanksgiving dinner for friends.\u000a<br /><br />\u000a<a href="http://trueswamp.wordpress.com/">John Lewis</a>: John told me he has been doing <i>True Swamp</i> since 1994.  I haven't been doing anything since 1994 but eating lunch every day and other useless shit.  Someone give the man a standing ovation.

I hope that in 2011 I will be able to balance more, and return to a dependable schedule.  It's a skill you learn as you go.  Thanks, always, for coming back to read, I'm glad you do.\u000a\u000a<br /><br />\u000aCan you believe I made an X-Files joke in 2010

It's a very good read, you may be surprised.\u000a\u000a<br /><br />\u000a\u000aThe <a href="http://www.topatoco.com/merchant.mvc?Screen=CTGY&Store_Code=TO&Category_Code=BEAT">Store</a> is actually starting to update with new material bit by bit, there are several shirts and mugs coming in, plus the onesie I mentioned!  But in the meantime, there are always prints available, which I keep not mentioning but let me tell you, it's true.\u000a\u000a<br /><br />\u000a\u000aAnd I have two interviews to tell you about, done with two very lovely and informed people! It was a pleasure.  Here they are:\u000a\u000a<br /><br />\u000athe first is the podcast <a href="http://www.jimmyaquino.typepad.com/comicnewsinsider/2010/10/episode-300-with-kevin-maguire-kate-beaton-michael-emerson-ben-mccool-molly-crabapple-veronica-taylo.html">Comics News Insider</a> with Joe Gonzalez and Jimmy Aquino, I was there for their 300th episode and they had some great guests!  \u000a\u000a<br /><br />\u000athe second is a long interview with Laura Hudson of <a href="http://www.comicsalliance.com/2010/10/21/kate-beaton-interview-marvel-comics-strange-tales/">Comics Alliance</a>.  I'm told it's interesting to read, so, phew.  I don't want to bore you.

And three for me today!  I must say, she has a talent to mimic my scribbles.  Enjoy!\u000a\u000a<br /><br />\u000aAn exciting note: I did illustrations for this month's issue of <a href="http://www.walrusmagazine.com/">The Walrus</a>, my favorite magazine.  Pick one up and check it out, if you are unfamiliar!  Some of the illustrations are also available <a href="http://www.walrusmagazine.com/articles/2010.10-online-exclusive-desktop-wallpapers-deux/">as a wallpaper download.</a>  Awesome!\u000a\u000a<br /><br />I have just come back from <a href="http://www.spxpo.com/">SPX</a>, thank you to all who came out!  I was nursing a bit of a painful biking injury and had to leave my table a few times and people were awful nice about it.  You guys are the best.  Now I am going to Vermont to give a talk at <a href="http://www.cartoonstudies.org/">The Center for Cartoon Studies</a>, which I am looking forward to seeing!  You can expect a comic when I return!\u000a\u000a<br /><br />\u000aHere's something you might be interested in:  My good friends Robbi and Matt run <a href="http://idiotsbooks.com/">Idiot's Books</a>, a very charming operation.  Since I have so many fans of literature reading my comics, I thought you might be totally into this poster that they did, <a href="http://idiotsbooks.com/?page_id=338&shopp_pid=126">Six Degrees of Francis Bacon</a>. Along with all the other great stuff they make, of course.
