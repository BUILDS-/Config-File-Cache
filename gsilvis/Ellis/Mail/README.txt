Here are the config files for my email setup, which works as follows:

All my email accounts redirect to my GMail account (george.iii.silvis).
Then, I run offlineIMAP on Ellis.
I run sup on Ellis through ssh.
I send mail from Ellis using msmtp.

These config files are edited from my actual use for personal reasons.
Such as not wanting you to read my email.
