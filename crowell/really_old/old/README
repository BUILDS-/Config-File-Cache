README for jcrowell config files

.vimrc : relatively simple vim config, used with cygwin's vim and visual studio
.bashrc : also simple, just alias-ing the csharp compiler mostly
rc.xml : openbox config, adding "aero-snap" keybindings to my openbox.
Config.ini : bug.n tiling wm config for windows.  Uses a nicer font, and reads in battery stats for usage on laptop, otherwise mostly stock
dark.vssettings : visual studio settings, dark theme, line numbers, different colorization.  mostly taken from studiostyl.es
