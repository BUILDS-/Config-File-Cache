This is my (now depricated) Mac OS X 10.6 configuration.

It was current as of 2011 02 07, but is now depricated.

MacPorts was installed on the system; Fink and Homebrew were not.

Four config files are included here:
     * .bash_profile - this is the standard profiling for login shells.  Note that all my shells were run as login shells.
     * .bashrc	     - also standard for Bash.  Its function was limited, as I was running all shells as login shells.
     * .bash_aliases - this is just a handy list of various aliases that .bashrc initialized.
     * .emacs	     - for the emacs environment.  I had ATS and Haskell installed, with custom modes for each.
