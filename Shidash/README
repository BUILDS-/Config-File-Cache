The following is a description of my configuration files for killua (ThinkPad X220) running Debian using xmonad as a window manager.
.emacs: My emacs config.
.msmtprc: This is what I use to send mail from my mail accounts.
.muttrc: Configuration file for mutt which changes how mutt runs and displays things. If you want to see how I setup accounts see my .msmtprc. This is setup to work with notmuch.
.offlineimaprc: offlineimap pulls my mail from all mail accounts through gmail.
.signature: My email signature.
.xinitrc: This runs on startup and starts my programs.
.xmobarrc: My xmobar config file made for use with trayer and two processors.
.xmonad/xmonad.hs: My xmonad config file which is fairly standard and minimal.
.xscreensaver: My xscreensaver config file.
.bashrc: Bash config file.
