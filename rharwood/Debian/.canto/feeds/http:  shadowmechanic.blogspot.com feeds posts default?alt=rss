VLast night, my mother listened to an opinion that she did not share. She found an add in a magazine stating "Not all autistics want to be cured". I have been telling her this for years, but she never listened to me until she saw it on her own.<br /><br />I was very happy. I then took this as an opportunity to show her some parts of the autism community she had refused to see before. First, I showed her a video I found at Autreat called 'No Pity'. Then I showed her part of the presentation that the same person made on <a href="http://vimeo.com/12901883">grading autistic people</a>.<br /><br />Why did I show her videos first? In the past, I have given her links but she never looked. Usually she said something about me slanting the stuff I gave her to support my side of the argument and refused to look. I sat down and watched these videos with her. She had to look. I wanted to open her mind a bit with the videos to get her thinking about the issues.<br /><br />Afterwards, I gave her a few links to various websites. We had a discussion that nearly degenerated into an argument but we stopped it before it did. That was great. It was the best conversation I have had with her in a long time.<br /><br />Today she printed some pages from the links I gave her. She does that when she really wants to read something. It took close to sixteen years, but she is open-minded about autism now. She does not agree with me on most issues still. However, she is thinking about my views and she listened to me. That is enough.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1848101302710400415-2400189845463846137?l=shadowmechanic.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>

VThe internet was the first place I passed as male. Initially I did not know why, but it made me happy whenever someone referred to me as he. The internet also aided in my discovery of the term transgender and, in a way, validated my feelings about it. It made me realise that it was not just me and it was not just a quirk related to autism.<br /><br />Fast forward several years. I changed my name on the school email. One of my mom's friends read her son's email and saw this. Despite it being a gender neutral name, she told my mom and my mom panicked. This was before I was out to her.<br /><br />Several months later I sent in a proposal for a presentation at an autism conference. A couple months after it was accepted. I corresponded with some people attending the conference. By then I had changed my name on my email to my male name. I sent the proposal in my birth name. The person running the conference contacted me about it because ze was confused. Ze was amazingly understanding and kept my name one way on the site while changing my name tag for the conference. I presented under my male name.<br /><br />However, using multiple names is confusing. Sometimes I try to stick to my gender-neutral screen name but I am switching that back. This becomes horribly confusing when talking to people at the lab. Some people at the lab know about this and others do not. A new person started helping my PI and she thought that she was talking to two different people.<br /><br />What is my solution? Against what people say I should do, I am going to have to be completely out and consistent at the lab. Proposals for conferences and the like will still be under my birth name for a bit. However, I will put the name that I want on my first scientific paper. That is my right.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1848101302710400415-7060505654680321248?l=shadowmechanic.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>

VI recently checked the DSM V for updates on their proposed changes to the criteria for autism. I was pleasantly surprised. It seems to be nearing completion. Before reading further, please click <a href="http://www.dsm5.org/ProposedRevisions/Pages/proposedrevision.aspx?rid=94">here</a> and read all four tabs.<br /><br />What they did makes sense. After all, social interaction and communication should fall in the same domain. Merging these also is a step forward in removing the stigma around autistics who cannot speak. The general set of criteria also begins to crack ideas about autistics being a certain, particular way.<br /><br />I find the page on severity particularly interesting. I have never supported functioning levels when used to describe autistics or the differentiation between autism, asperger's, and PDD (which are the same disorder). That said, the severity page is tasteful. It works for insurance purposes and will help more people get the coverage they need. It also does not pick out any particular skills as being the determining factor in support or degrade people who have certain deficits. It simply speaks in terms of support required. I hope that documents like this become more prevalent and help in breaking down the barriers that people face. This is probably the best outcome at this time. I hope that the DSM committee does not drastically modify their proposed criteria before publication.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1848101302710400415-6389469492698624578?l=shadowmechanic.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>

VEver since I finally started to wear men's clothes more and more, I have cared about my appearance more in a proportional amount. Actually, it might also be because I am seriously attracted to someone for the first time as well. I have no idea. Before I wanted to look masculine, but that was it. At first it was just hygiene. I was sure to brush my teeth well, wash my hair, put on deoderant, and apply chap stick. This was good as sometimes I had minor issues with that before. This is not an uncommon issue for people on the autism spectrum.<br /><br />Now I find myself not just focusing on hygiene but on other things. I am trying to lose weight and doing okay. I do not let my clothes get too dirty. Most of all, I keep wondering what makes a person likeable and attractive. <br /><br />I think I am fairly likeable as a friend and have a decent personality. Please correct me if I am wrong. But this attraction business is new to me. Sometimes I wonder if I will ever be liked as a male. Physically I seem to have little chance and even losing weight and staying clean will only help a little. However, I have observed that much of attraction seems to be personality based.<br /><br />I do not want to change my personality. I would like to minimise its flaws. The issue is that I do not know very much about my personality and no one I have asked can seem to pinpoint it. I wish I could break this into clear-cut segments, but it does not work that way.<br /><br />Some people say that I have a good personality, but as far as I know, no one has been attracted to me. Maybe I am not cut out for that sort of thing. Do I lack a sense of humor? A good smile? Am I too awkward? What am I doing wrong?<br /><br />Drat it, I dislike whining but this sort of thing is confusing and nearly hopeless for someone who is autistic and transgendered. People keep saying that someone will love me sometime but somehow I doubt it as the days pass.<br /><br />I hate myself for thinking this way. It makes me seem like a shallow person, even to myself. I have never been like this before.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1848101302710400415-4065518719065746154?l=shadowmechanic.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>

VToday I joined the school chorus. I sang for four years in middle school but I have not since. Back then, I did not know how to read music and mostly picked things up by ear. I still do. This is changing.<br /><br />In the past several months, I started to care about music a whole lot more. I really loved singing in middle school so joining a chorus was the natural place to start. Actually, for me, research is the first place. When I get interested in something, I want to be good at it. I searched a bit and found a conservatory music program for high schoolers. My mom and I contacted a few teachers there. I also found a chorus that sings medieval music but it meets too late at night. I hope to join this later.<br /><br />I did go to that chorus that meets late at night once. It was great. Everyone accepted me as a guy with no questions. I even successfully sang tenor (my voice is quite low). Afterwards, I showed one of my friends the music and he pointed me to the school chorus, saying that I should show the teacher this music because he loves early music.<br /><br />I went and talked to the teacher who runs the chorus that day. I showed him the music and told him about my plans to start lessons at the conservatory. He seemed very interested in it. Then he asked if the chorus that I had been to that one time was a mixed or all male group. I was surprised. He thought I was a guy. This made me very happy.<br /><br />However, there was also a slight issue. The parts when singing are gendered and, as faculty in a small school, he was going to find out that I am biologically female one time or another. Until then, I had just sung tenor or jumped between alto and baritone (in middle school when we did not have a tenor section). Joining this chorus was my first semi-serious step into the world of music. I wanted to train my voice like a male would because after I go on testosterone my voice will drop. Also, I dislike being lumped with the girls and the higher notes in the alto range are very hard for me to reach.<br /><br />I talked to the faculty member who runs the GSA. I am no longer allowed to go to the GSA but I still talk to the teacher in charge of it. He offered to talk to the chorus teacher for me. I guess he did too.<br /><br />Today I just walked in and he handed me some music. He said that my voice might be a tenor or countertenor but he would try me as a tenor today. It went well. Everyone else already knew the music a bit and had more musical experience so I was a bit quiet. But the person teaching referred to me as a guy. And no one stopped him. I want to keep it this way if I can.<br /><br />I have no idea what will happen at the conservatory or if my parents will find out about school and get angry. However, even when you are afraid, you have to do what will make you happy. Otherwise there is no point in doing it at all.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1848101302710400415-4119774413413105291?l=shadowmechanic.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>

VMost people do not remember much of their childhood. Even those memories retained are unreliable. I remember a lot, at least those things of interest to me. The rest I do not remember at all. This is how my memory seems to work and it is not uncommon to find this sort of memory among autistics.<br /><br />I remember fleeting thoughts about gender but for the most part I just thought that these were another part of me being different from the other kids. Here are some of my memories.<br /><br />In preschool, I would spend time with the older boys out making forts. I loved this and they accepted me as one of their own.<br /><br />At age four, I asked my mom how babies were made and how the parents chose the gender. As I was young and my mom was very religious, she told me that the parents prayed to God very hard for a child. In these prayers, they specified the gender. I then asked about changing gender. She said that if a person prayed very hard then God may change his or her gender. My mom denies she ever said this.<br /><br />Around age four I started rejecting skirts, dresses, and most types of tights. This was partially because of sensory issues that made them uncomfortable but also because they felt wrong as a whole.<br /><br />At age five, I would walk around the playground playing a game with a friend where we pretended to be characters from the show Dragon Tales. I was always the male dragon.<br /><br />My hobbies were never particularly feminine or masculine. I played outside, read books, used the computer, and was interested in everything to do with animals. I had both dolls and trucks but I never really played much with either. When I played with toys, they were either sensory things like play-doh or animal figures which would be pawns in my epic stories.<br /><br />In elementary school, I lead playground wars. I did not get in trouble for this until fourth grade, surprisingly. I always played with younger kids because they were easier to interact with and they never bullied me. In the winter, we would go sledding down a small hill and build snow forts. I did not have good friends but people tolerated me even if most stayed away from me and thought of me as a freak.<br /><br />I was never good at sports. This is both fortunate and unfortunate. If I was, I might have told my parents earlier but life would have been more unbearable. I would also have to deal with what others thought. At the school I was at, the only academically-inclined kids seemed to be girls. I still spent time with boys though when I played. For the most part I was a social outcast but I did interact with others a bit. I quickly learned to not care what others thought about me.<br /><br />However, some moments still shine through where I thought about gender. I always loved dressing like my dad on father's day and dreaded mother's day. Eventually I fought to wear pants to church and for school photos. I still looked like a girl but at least I was not in a dress or a skirt.<br /><br />In first grade, one girl mentioned that her father called her a tomboy. I asked what that meant. She said a girl who acts like a boy. I liked this word. It was the closest thing I had to describing myself.<br /><br />In the school plays, I always was happy with the unisex costumes that we wore. It was one area where there was no gender separation in clothing or anything.<br /><br />In third grade, the clothes I wore under one Halloween costume looked very masculine. I liked this. It made me happy, although I did not know why. Until then, I just liked bright clothes with animals on them.<br /><br />When sledding, I always liked the snowpants and clothes the boys had on. I eventually got some that looked a bit more like it. In general I ignored clothes. That was the first I really thought about them.<br /><br />I spent most of my time all through middle school in my own imaginary world. There I was just me. I could be a boy in my own world. Almost all of the other characters in my world were male as well.<br /><br />When I started going online, I identified myself as female in habit. However, when someone said he when talking about me, I felt a surge of joy. I eventually left gender on forums blank and let people guess. Most of the time they guessed male. In roleplay games I would always play a male character as well.&nbsp; <br /><br />These are only a few of my memories on my prepubescent thoughts on gender. For the most part, I ignored it. I grew up in a conservative town in Maine but gender roles were not too strictly enforced. As a child, the only things different between the other boys and me were clothing and hairstyle. I could live with this as I never care for looks or how others perceive me. My childhood was not easy; I was lonely, strange, and dealing with other issues. However, the real trials were not apparent yet.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1848101302710400415-4506805249939568360?l=shadowmechanic.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>

VI thought about not posting poetry because over the past years the idea that unmetered poetry is bad has been forced upon me. If people have complaints, tell me and I will stop.<br /><br />People also say not to insert the author's life into poetry in analysis. In this case, my life is crucial to understanding the true meaning.<br /><br />Shadows glistening on the ice,<br />flakes enveloping the grass,<br />winter arrives tonight,<br />the snow returns at last.<br /><br />People shiver in dread,<br />children cry out with glee,<br />the coming cold marches steadily on<br />into a freezing eternity.<br /><br />A light glistens in the distance, <br />faintly and precariously.<br />Although the cutting chills endure,<br />perhaps people can sustain <br />with that little light in mind.<br /><br />Eternity is not infinite,<br />time thaws away<br />and with it the water runs,<br />ushering in a bright spring day.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1848101302710400415-1280306301470596629?l=shadowmechanic.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>

VThe shadows make me comfortable. As a young child, I watched my shadow change and morph with great fascination. Most people see shadows as a warped reflection of reality. Not so for me. Shadows were clearer than reality. Not so anymore. Yet, I still lurk here in the darkness.<br /><br />I am transgendered, gay, and autistic. Those  will be my primary topics although some academic and philosophical  topics might come up in the process.&nbsp; <br /><br />This blog will be a mix of journal entries, essays, and stories about my past. I might also post some news articles, commentaries, and reviews. Do not expect it to be highly polished. However, I will post often and write fairly well.<br /><br />Please read whatever interests you. I will tag posts so that people can read only certain parts of this if they wish. However, I encourage you to read it all.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1848101302710400415-12571780613745147?l=shadowmechanic.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>

Vp { margin-bottom: 0.08in; }  <br /><div>Disclaimer: Events might not be reported exactly as they occurred. People mentioned hold no responsibility for their roles in this. For all anyone knows, I could be making this up. </div><div><br /></div><div>I write from the darkest days of my short life. Dark, yet somehow shining towards the future at once. A future so bright that it makes the darkness itself shine. Indeed, sometimes I stop in my tracks blinded by the light. I have come to tolerate, even enjoy, the shadows. This is the forbidden story I have penned about my journey.</div><div><br /></div><div> The real storm began on a bright, June day in Massachusetts. June twenty-fourth. I woke up late as usual. Teenagers do that. The second summer semester had not yet started and that day was a day off from the lab. I had already finished my presentation for the conference so there was no harm in staying home. Staying home would not be relaxing though and I knew it. I had known it for three months.</div><div><br /></div><div> At around noon J. arrived in her beaten up six-year-old car, bought just one year after she started working with me. She entered the house quickly and began her meeting with my mom to learn of the days tasks. She was a no-nonsense kind of woman like that. Most of the time.</div><div><br /></div><div> My mother surely gave her all sorts of unreasonable requests to get me to do insane numbers of chores under the guise of 'independent living'. Okay, so I did have to learn some of the things like picking up after myself, doing laundry, taking care of my dog, and even some minor cooking. I did all of them for J. Not my mom though. I always stayed away from her.</div><div><br /></div><div> About a half an hour after J. arrived she ventured upstairs. In near silence we began the day's chores. We both knew what today was; June 24<sup>th</sup>, the day that would change everything. In the end we walked down to the Koi pond as my white, fluffy dog trotted along next to us.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div> \u201cI am nervous. How will my mom react?\u201d I finally asked.</div><div><br /></div><div> \u201cI have no idea but you have prepared for it as best as you can. I still do not think you should tell her now. Telling her when you are in college would be much easier,\u201d J. wisely replied.</div><div><br /></div><div> I disregarded it, \u201cHow will she react? You are good at reading people. Surely you must have some idea.\u201d</div><div><br /></div><div> We stood overlooking the Koi pond staring at the orange fish darting amongst the lilly pads, hardly visible. I chastised my dog for trying to take a drink. J. stood and though.</div><div><br /></div><div> Finally she responded. \u201cWell, I think she will cry a lot and it will take her a while to go through the stages of grief. She is a religious woman and this changes her whole idea of the child she was raising. She will still love you though.\u201d</div><div><br /></div><div> At this point we turned and slowly walked up the hill, dreading to reach the house where our conversation must end.</div><div><br /></div><div> \u201cAt least we are going away right after this. Then she can have some time to herself to think this over,\u201d I said.</div><div><br /></div><div> \u201cYes, that will probably be for the best.\u201d</div><div><br /></div><div> We looked on as my dog dashed after a squirrel and circled the tree as if she expected it to come down and play with her. Then she dove onto the grass head-first and rolled. We sat down underneath a large tree and let her flail and tumble on the ground.</div><div><br /></div><div> \u201cWhat do you think of this whole situation?\u201d I asked. I already knew the answer but I needed someone to reassure me that I was not crazy.</div><div><br /></div><div> \u201cYou know what I think. I will always love and accept you no matter who or what you are; man, woman, or person. Even if you decided you were a dog I would accept it.\u201d</div><div><br /></div><div> I stifled a laugh. It was a reference to my days spent as a programmer for a furry roleplay game. We both looked off into the distance as the wind blew through the grass and trees.</div><div><br /></div><div>J. finally spoke up. "This seems like the beginning of a coming of age story. It is just like the ones I have read."</div><div><br /></div><div>"Yes, the calm before the storm as well." I agreed.</div><div><br /></div><div>Looking back, it was. It was even like a certain book I read in middle school about a Massachusetts boy in a summer session at a school before everything went downhill. The beginning might be the only thing in common with that story. It became a modern conflict quite quickly.</div><div></div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1848101302710400415-7498654610560878721?l=shadowmechanic.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>
