custom.desktop -- In (x/k)ubuntu, there is no option at GDM for running your own
.xsession script. Putting this in the right place (probably
/usr/share/xsessions/ ) lets you pick the 'Custom' option.

Mail/README.txt -- essential for understanding that folder.

Mail/config.yaml -- sup!

Mail/offlineimaprc -- pretty self-explanatory

Mail/.sources.yaml -- also for sup

Mail/.msmtprc -- for sending mail
