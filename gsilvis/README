Contents:

.cabal/config  --  for Cabal (Package manager for the GHC, the Glasgow Haskell
Compiler).

.vimrc  --  for vim, the best command line editor on the planet

.xsession  --  Script that is run on startup with many distros of Linux (for
Ubuntu, see below)

custom.desktop  --  On Ubuntu, you need to put this in the right directory (for
me it's /usr/share/xsessions/ ), and then pick Custom as your session at login.
Then Ubuntu will run your .xsession script.

xmonad.hs  --  for XMonad, a lightweight tiling window manager. Put in
~/.xmonad/xmonad.hs

.xmobarrc  --  for XMobar, a status bar that works well with XMonad. Put in
home. By the way ledmon can be found on John Goerzen's xmonad config page.

template.tex  --  A TeX header that contains several mathematical commands I use
often, as well as a nice formatting.

.mpdconf  --  configuration file for the Music Player Daemon. Put in home.

mpdscribble.conf  --  config for mpdscribbler, a scrobbler for mpd.

mpdmonitor.sh  --  Used by xmobar; outputs to stdout the current song each time
it changes. Do not use with mpc version 0.19; an important feature was not yet
implemented, and this script will enter a very tight loop. Put wherever your
.xmobarrc expectes to find it. [I don't use this anymore, and recommend that you
do not either.]

Mail -- This folder contains stuff to do with email. (surprise, surprise!)

Enjoy
