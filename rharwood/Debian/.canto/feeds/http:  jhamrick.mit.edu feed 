V<p>Wow, it&#8217;s been a long time since I blogged last.  I should fix that.  Also, the site has a new theme!  I hope you enjoy it.  Anyway, onto the content&#8230;</p>\u000a<hr />Over the course of the years, I came to realize that I was dissatisfied with my email solution.  Back in middle school, I used Hotmail (yuck).  Then Gmail came out, which was shiny and fantastic, and I used that exclusively until I came to MIT.  Once I discovered SSH and that pine was automatically configured with all my mail on Athena machines, I started using that.  Then I found alpine.  Then I got tired of having to SSH into a screen session somewhere every time I wanted to check my mail, so I switched back to Gmail again.  I eventually became frustrated with GMail&#8217;s slowness and the fact that they didn&#8217;t support GPG, so I switched back to MIT&#8217;s IMAP and used Thunderbird.  And so the hilarity began&#8230;</p>\u000a<p>That was roughly six months ago.  I have since settled on something more satisfactory, but still by no means perfect (more on why it is unsatisfactory in a minute).  But I have certainly learned a great deal about email and email clients in the process, so hopefully I can share with you my trials and tribulations to make your own search easier.</p>\u000a<p>By the time I started using Thunderbird for the first time, I had a pretty good idea of what things I wanted in my email solution:</p>\u000a<ol>\u000a<li><strong>Speed</strong>.  I want my mail client to load emails quickly and to perform operations quickly.  I hate that Gmail tends to load so slowly (either the website or its IMAP interface); I want to be able to manipulate my emails fast and easily.</li>\u000a<li><strong>Server-Side Address Book.</strong> It is so irritating to have to take all my contacts and export them  and load them on my other computers, and synchronize them every so  often.  It&#8217;s more trouble than it&#8217;s worth, so when there&#8217;s no way to do it, I just end up not  bothering with an address book at all.  Unfortunately, there really isn&#8217;t a solution to this outside of Gmail.  Well, there&#8217;s LDAP, but that doesn&#8217;t <em>really</em> count, and there&#8217;s Exchange, but if I switch to Exchange at MIT then there&#8217;s no going back, and I don&#8217;t want to be locked into something like that.</li>\u000a<li><strong>Server-Side Filters.</strong> I really don&#8217;t want to have to implement the dozens of filters I have on every one of my computers.  Again, the only real solution to this is Gmail (and Gmail&#8217;s filtering system kind of sucks because it doesn&#8217;t support regexes).</li>\u000a<li><strong>GPG Support. </strong>Some people laugh at me for signing all my emails with my GPG key, but I like to try to follow the &#8220;safe is better than sorry&#8221; mantra.  No, I&#8217;m not <em>actually</em> worried that somebody is going to try to impersonate me over email, but you never know, right?  Most clients have support for GPG in some way or another, but it varies on how well it works.  Gmail&#8217;s web interface doesn&#8217;t have any GPG capabilities at all (though I&#8217;ve heard a rumor you can use FireGPG to do it for you).</li>\u000a<li><strong>Android Support.</strong> However I access my mail from my computers, I want to be able to access it in the same way from my phone.  That includes being alerted when I have new mail, and not having to run ConnectBot to SSH somewhere to check it.</li>\u000a<li><strong>Threading.</strong> It&#8217;s gotta have threading.  Ok, it&#8217;s workable if you&#8217;re using a computer with a large enough screen that can also store all your mail (e.g., tens of thousands of messages), but you can&#8217;t do that on a phone.  If I need to be able to find an email, I want to be able to do it because the thread is in my inbox, and not have to search for each message in the thread individually.  Really good threading (like that found in <a href="http://sup.rubyforge.org/">sup</a>) is preferable, but even Gmail-style threading is good enough for me.</li>\u000a</ol>\u000a<p>Gmail has 4/6 of these, with the two missing being speed and GPG support.  Not too shabby.  But when I&#8217;ve just woken up and am checking my mail, and it&#8217;s taking a minute to load, it&#8217;s enough to make me want to switch to something better.</p>\u000a<p>For a while I tried just using Thunderbird with MIT&#8217;s IMAP, but that lacks server side address-booking, filters, and in practice Android support as well, as I have not yet found an email client on Android (besides the Gmail app) that handles threading.  This solution just wasn&#8217;t satisfactory enough for me, so I tried using Thunderbird with Gmail&#8217;s IMAP.  That gave me 5/6, but dramatically decreased the speed at which emails loaded.  Well, maybe it was the same speed as using the web, but it at least <em>felt</em> like it was slower, because every time you clicked on a folder, it would have to refresh the folder, and then every time you clicked on a message, it would have to refresh the message&#8230; it was ugly, and not very fun.  Furthermore, because of the way that Gmail&#8217;s IMAP works, you end up with multiple copies of every message: one in Inbox, one in All Mail, and one in every other folder that corresponds to any tags the email might have.  When you read the message in the Inbox, the messages in the other folders remain unread until the next sync, which bugs the hell out of me.</p>\u000a<p>So, Gmail IMAP + Thunderbird was a no.  At this point, I was feeling adventurous, so I decided to set up my own mail server.  I installed Cyrus and Postfix on my server, and set up my own filters using <a href="http://sieve.info/">Sieve</a>.  I attempted to use LDAP for address booking, but quickly gave up on that because LDAP is horribly confusing and opaque.  This worked pretty well in conjunction with Thunderbird &#8212; I had speedy email retrieval, server-side filters, GPG support, and threading.  After a while, though, I became fed up with how much of a pain in the ass it was to update my filters (I had to SSH to my server and update the filter file by hand, then re-add it to the Sieve configuration).  Furthermore, I was still bumping into the same no-threading-support-on-Android problem as I had with MIT IMAP.</p>\u000a<p>Back to the drawing board.  I switched back to MIT IMAP and started running <a href="http://sup.rubyforge.org/">sup</a> in a screen session on my server.  Sup is a wonderful little program; it&#8217;s terminal-based (which I like) and has the best threading support I&#8217;ve ever seen (you can even join threads together that it misses!).  It&#8217;s also blindingly fast, because you have to set up <a href="https://github.com/jgoerzen/offlineimap/wiki">offlineimap</a> to fetch all of your mail, and then sup just loads it off of the disk.  I used sup for nearly six months before its cons started to gnaw at me &#8212; it has a terrible address book, I couldn&#8217;t get GPG to work, it doesn&#8217;t play nicely with other mail clients, and crashes more frequently than I would like.  I had been running sup out of the <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/sup-devel@rubyforge.org/msg00566.html">maildir-sync</a> branch, which at least allowed me to mark messages as read/deleted/etc. on the server.  However, because sup does everything with labels (as opposed to folders), accessing your mail from a normal IMAP client is a pain.  I would get email on my phone and read it, but when when I got back to my computer, I&#8217;d have to go through and archive all the emails I&#8217;d already read (and, of course, I still had the Android threading issue).  I don&#8217;t like having to go through messages twice if they&#8217;re unimportant, so having to do that was a big nuisance for me.</p>\u000a<p>I decided to give Gmail IMAP + Thunderbird another go, but the moment I brought it up I knew I would get fed up with the slowness soon.  My adventures with sup had taught me about <a href="https://github.com/jgoerzen/offlineimap/wiki">offlineimap</a>, so I thought, &#8220;why not use offlineimap to make Thunderbird load messages faster?&#8221;.  This required a bit more work than I initially thought &#8212; Thunderbird doesn&#8217;t support accessing Maildirs directly; you have to actually access an IMAP or POP server.  To solve this, I installed <a href="http://www.dovecot.org/">Dovecot</a>, pointed it at my Maildir, and just had it listen locally for IMAP connections.  Then I was able to point Thunderbird at the local IMAP server, and voila!  I had fixed my speed problem.  I set up a cron job to run offlineimap every few minutes, and installed the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/addon/153352/">RunBeforeGetMail</a> plugin to allow me to run offlineimap <em>right now</em> if I really wanted to.  The one downside with offlineimap is that it is kind of slow in updating, but that&#8217;s to be expected because Gmail is so slow in the first place.</p>\u000a<p>So, Gmail IMAP + offlineimap + Dovecot + Thunderbird is my current solution, and I&#8217;m fairly happy with it.  I can access my emails quickly, I have a synchronized server-side addressbook and filtering system, I have GPG and Android support, and some amount of threading (Thunderbird doesn&#8217;t do threading that well, but it&#8217;s good enough).  The only problem that really still remains is that duplicate messages in All Mail or other folders don&#8217;t get marked as read until the next sync.  This is irritating, and may cause me to switch eventually, but more than likely I&#8217;ll end up writing a plugin for Thunderbird to mark those messages as read automagically.</p>\u000a<p>If you&#8217;d like to duplicate my mail setup, here&#8217;s what you need to do:</p>\u000a<ol>\u000a<li>Turn on IMAP in Gmail.</li>\u000a<li>Install offlineimap and configure it to access your Gmail IMAP.  You might need to be careful when syncing for the first time if you have a lot of messages; I reached the daily bandwidth limit (twice) as I was bringing offlineimap up to speed.  This will also take an extremely long time, as again, Gmail is slow.</li>\u000a<li>Install Dovecot and configure it to access the Maildir where offlineimap stores your email.  Unless you want to be able to access this email remotely, you probably want to have Dovecot only listen to localhost.</li>\u000a<li>Install Thunderbird and point it at your local configuration.  You can just put in &#8216;localhost&#8217; and whatever port you&#8217;re using for the incoming settings, and then use Google&#8217;s SMTP server to send mail (or, if you&#8217;re like me and don&#8217;t actually use your Gmail address, point it at some other SMTP server, like MIT&#8217;s).</li>\u000a<li>Install some Thunderbird plugins!  I would be very unhappy with my current setup without the following (and as of this writing, I am running Thunderbird 3.1.7):\u000a<ul>\u000a<li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/addon/71/">Enigmail</a> &#8211; adds GPG support</li>\u000a</ul>\u000a<ul>\u000a<li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/addon/59195/">G-Hub Lite</a> &#8211; adds tabs for various Google services (I use Calendar, Voice, Reader, and sometimes Docs)</li>\u000a</ul>\u000a<ul>\u000a<li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/addon/54035/">Gmail Conversation View</a> &#8211; significantly improves Thunderbird&#8217;s threading experience, by displaying entire conversations (even after you&#8217;ve archived some of the messages in that thread)</li>\u000a<li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/addon/7307/">Google Contacts</a> &#8211; allows you to use Google Contacts for your address book.</li>\u000a<li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/addon/14896/">Message Archive Options</a> &#8211; allows you to archive messages into just one folder, as opposed to creating separate folders for each year</li>\u000a<li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/addon/153352/">RunBeforeGetMail</a> &#8211; lets you run an external command before Thunderbird fetches your mail (but it only works when you actually press the &#8216;Get Mail&#8217; button)</li>\u000a</ul>\u000a</li>\u000a</ol>\u000a<p>Hopefully this will help some of you figure out a solution to your mail troubles.  There is no perfect solution, but I feel like this at least gets pretty close.</p>

V<p>A few months ago, I blogged about <a href="http://jhamrick.mit.edu/2010/07/27/social-problems-in-computer-science/">problems in the hacker world</a>.  One of the biggest issues that people ended up mentioning in comments and other discussion with me is that it is important for less-experienced people to ask intelligent questions of the more-experienced people.  If they are able to do that, then the more-experienced hackers will be able to help faster and more easily, and will be more likely to put the effort into providing a helpful response.  So&#8230; how do you ask good questions?</p>\u000a<p>The classic guide is <a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html">How To Ask Questions The Smart Way</a>, which I was pointed at as recently as a year ago to improve my question-asking skills (and, coincidentally, I&#8217;ve become much more technically competent in the past year).  Since reading that article, I&#8217;ve think that I&#8217;ve significantly improved my ability to do research beforehand, and to formulate well thought-out questions before asking them.  The article is quite long, so I&#8217;ll summarize a few of the more relevant points here (but I highly encourage you to go read the whole thing yourself).  I&#8217;m focusing more here on people who are beginning hackers, as opposed to users with questions.</p>\u000a<ol>\u000a<li><strong>Do research beforehand.</strong> If you have a question to ask, you should try to find the answer yourself before you go ask somebody else.  One of the things that&#8217;s most valued in the hacker community is the ability to find things out yourself.  Most of the people that you view as extremely competent and awesome and smart got that way because they went to all the effort to find things out for themselves.  If you never do the work yourself, then you won&#8217;t learn the answers as well.  Furthermore, having the <em>ability</em> to find answers itself is very useful &#8212; what happens when you become an expert in your field, and there is nobody else to ask questions of?  If you don&#8217;t have the ability to find the answers for yourself, then you will have hit a dead end.</li>\u000a<li><strong>Include as much information as possible. </strong>Don&#8217;t just say that your computer or some program is broken and it needs to be fixed, say <em>how</em> it&#8217;s broken.  For example, if Firefox keeps freezing when you start it up, say so!  Don&#8217;t just say &#8220;Firefox doesn&#8217;t work any more&#8221;; people aren&#8217;t mind readers, and we won&#8217;t be able to help you if you don&#8217;t give us specific information on the problem.  Furthermore, if you&#8217;ve tried to fix it yourself (see #1), say what research you&#8217;ve done (e.g. what you&#8217;ve Googled for) and what you might have done to try to fix the problem.  Don&#8217;t say what you <em>think</em> might be wrong unless you have evidence to back it up; otherwise, it&#8217;s just irrelevant and unhelpful.</li>\u000a<li><strong>Ask about methods or pointers rather than concrete solutions.</strong> Occasionally, you just need a factual answer to a question, but more often than not, it&#8217;s more useful to ask for pointers or methods of solving the problem.  If you&#8217;re asking about some large aspect of a program or project, then it is probably better to ask for documentation that you can read.  First of all, the person you&#8217;re asking probably doesn&#8217;t have time to tell you about all of it; second, you&#8217;ll now have a resource you can refer to again and again when you forget details.  For example, if I wanted to learn about AFS, I might ask a hacker friend to point me at a document giving a good overview of AFS (and they might point me at <a href="http://sipb.mit.edu/doc/afs-and-you/">AFS and You</a>, though I should have been able to find that by Googling &#8220;afs mit&#8221;).  In other cases, if you do not know the solution to a problem, you might want to ask what sort of method or tool you can use to solve your problem, and where a good overview of using that tool would be.  In another example, if I wanted to know how to add user-defined variables into my Debian package, I would ask how that is done.  My friend might tell me about Debconf, and point me to a <a href="http://www.fifi.org/doc/debconf-doc/tutorial.html">tutorial</a> on using it.  In both of these examples, the questioner gains a new tool or resource.  If the person they were asking had just fixed their problem for them, then they wouldn&#8217;t have learned anything new, and would know just as little as they did before.</li>\u000a<li><strong>Be polite.</strong> Don&#8217;t expect people to give you their time freely at your beck and call.  If they are going to help you, they&#8217;re doing it because they&#8217;re <em>volunteering</em> their time (and most likely, they are usually busy with a lot of other projects).  If you&#8217;re going to ask them a question, then at least be respectful of the fact that they&#8217;re helping you out of the goodness of their hearts, and that they don&#8217;t have endless time or patience.  In addition, if you are polite, then they&#8217;ll be more likely to be polite as well.</li>\u000a<li><strong>Don&#8217;t grovel.</strong> Just because you&#8217;re new and ignorant of a lot of the tools and methods that experienced hackers use doesn&#8217;t mean that you are incompetent or incapable of learning them.  Don&#8217;t act like you are!  Just state your question clearly and with confidence.  Apologizing for not knowing anything or being new or whatever isn&#8217;t going to help your case; if anything, it will hurt your chances of getting help, because claiming that you&#8217;re incompetent implies that you can&#8217;t or are unwilling to learn anything new.  Giving that impression is perhaps the worst possible thing you can do:  we want to help people who are eager to learn, but are instantly turned off by people just seeking someone to do the work for them.</li>\u000a</ol>\u000a<p>Do you have other points that you find important when asking (or answering) questions?  If there was one thing you would encourage people to do when asking questions, what would it be?  On the flip side, how can more experienced people answer questions better?  What problems do you run into on that end?</p>

V<p>Wow, things are crazy.  Classes and the rest of my responsibilities have hit like a tidal wave, and I finally am able to start swimming towards the surface to get some air.  I&#8217;m only taking 3.5 classes this term, but I&#8217;m also working on my awesome UROP 15-20 hours a week, on top of being SIPB Chair, writing a game for the MIT Assassin&#8217;s Guild, being pika&#8217;s senior house manager, and being pika&#8217;s computer chair.  I always love being this busy, but sometimes I wonder if I like it a little <em>too</em> much.  It&#8217;s hard to find a term when I&#8217;m <em>not</em> in over my head.  But, regardless, things are going well and I&#8217;m excited to almost be done with my undergraduate career!</p>\u000a<p>So, what else?  I don&#8217;t really have the time to compose a full-fledged post (I&#8217;ll get to the rest of those security posts soon, I promise&#8230;), so I&#8217;m going to talk about why Python&#8217;s NumPy is awesome.</p>\u000a<p>For my UROP this summer, I created an experiment which involves looking at towers of blocks; I coded the whole interface in Python using Panda3D.  One of the first tasks was to create a way to randomly generate towers, with a few constraints:  blocks may only be placed within a <em>n</em> by <em>n</em> square in the xy plane, and blocks must be &#8220;locally stable&#8221; &#8212; that is, if you just look at the block you are placing and the block(s) directly beneath it, the block you&#8217;re placing needs to be able to sit on the block(s) below it and not fall off.  Of course, this guarantees nothing about the overall stability of the tower, but it does guarantee that individual blocks themselves are stable. In order to represent which blocks are where, a &#8220;depth map&#8221; is maintained, where the value for each grid square is the <em>z</em> value of the highest block at that point.</p>\u000a<p>Unfortunately, having the &#8220;locally stable&#8221; constraint makes it more difficult to place blocks.  You can&#8217;t just randomly pick a pair of (x, y) coordinates to place it, because they need to be stable.  You want to be able to examine the list of all locally-stable positions, and then choose a coordinate pair from that.  So how do you determine if it&#8217;s locally stable?  The naive approach (which is the one that I initially took) is to iterate through every single point and check to see if it&#8217;s locally stable.  To see if it&#8217;s stable, you need to check every point within the area that the block occupies.  If we assume the origin to be at the center of the block, then we need the block to be supported in +<em>x</em>, -<em>x</em>, +<em>y</em>, and -<em>y</em>, which essentially means that there must be at least two points of the maximum height for that sub-&#8221;depth map&#8221; that are diagonally across from each other.  So, we are looping through every coordinate in the world and then through every coordinate that the block covers. Long story short, it&#8217;s slooowwww.</p>\u000a<p>So, where does NumPy come into this?  If we use matrix operations instead of for loops, then the whole stability calculation becomes lightning fast.  At the start of the program, the depth map is initialized to all zeros, and then a list is created of every possible &#8220;slice&#8221; &#8212; that is, the area where a block could potentially rest.  Then, when calculating which spots are valid, we look at each slice, find the maximum, and then compare the slice to the maximum (e.g. numpy.array(slice &gt; numpy.max(slice), dtype=numpy.bool)).  Then, you do an element-wise <em>and</em> with a bitmask, which represents whether a given coordinate provides +<em>x</em>, -<em>x</em>, +<em>y</em>, and/or -<em>y</em>.  Finally, you sum over every coordinate in the slice matrix, and if the result has a 1 for every bit, then it is a valid spot to place a block.</p>\u000a<p>It sounds like a lot of these operations require iteration and wouldn&#8217;t be much faster than using for loops anyway.  In some cases, I&#8217;ve glossed over the actual techniques I used to do the calculation (e.g. finding the maximum of each slice can be done with matrix operations, and does not require a loop).  In other cases, I am sure that NumPy does use loops, but in a very effective and efficient manner.  If I had the time to source dive, I&#8217;d take a look and see what the running times for their algorithms are.</p>\u000a<p>Anyway, enough of my sleep-deprived ramblings.  I am quite happy with how NumPy enables fast and easy matrix manipulations.  Perhaps I am just fascinated by the efficiency of matrix operations themselves.  But, in any case, NumPy is another point in Python&#8217;s favour &#8212; while Python is not my favourite language, when it comes to cases like this, it is certainly the most convenient.</p>

V<h2><span>Hacking Websites and Computers</span></h2>\u000a<p>This is the second post in a series of blog posts about computer security:</p>\u000a<ul>\u000a<li><a href="http://jhamrick.mit.edu/2010/07/07/what-is-computer-security-and-why-should-i-care-part-1/">Part 1 &#8211; Introduction</a></li>\u000a<li><a href="http://jhamrick.mit.edu/2010/08/04/what-is-computer-security-and-why-should-i-care-part-2/">Part 2 &#8211; Hacking Websites and Computers</a></li>\u000a<li>Part 3 &#8211; Man-in-the-Middle Attacks</li>\u000a<li>Part 4 &#8211; Router Hacking</li>\u000a<li>Part 5 &#8211; Internet and Wireless Connection Snooping</li>\u000a</ul>\u000a<p>Recall Ben and Louis from the introduction. Both of them have houses, both of which are potential points of attack for Eve. Hopefully, both of them lock their doors and windows, or Eve could walk right in.  Even if they do lock the entrances to their houses, Eve might be a skilled lockpicker. When people have valuable possessions that they need to protect, they will buy high-grade locks that are difficult to pick in order to keep intruders out. With the exception of locking mechanisms themselves, physical security is relatively easy to judge because you can see it. If you have thicker doors and windows, they are harder to break down. If you have security guards, it is harder to sneak in.</p>\u000a<p>Unfortunately, computer security isn&#8217;t so obvious. Attacks are done electronically instead of physically, and you can&#8217;t see electricity (and even if you could, the signals that a computer processes are so complex that you would not be able to interpret them).  It is therefore very easy, so to speak, to leave the &#8220;front door&#8221; of your computer wide open.</p>\u000a<p>One might argue that it&#8217;s not a big deal for the average user, because who&#8217;s going to target them?  They don&#8217;t have anything of value, right?  Wrong.  Most people store passwords and credit card numbers on their computers.  If it&#8217;s easy to break in, why not?  Credit card numbers are a criminal&#8217;s goldmine, and passwords lead to more credit card numbers.  The computer itself is of value; attackers can use it to propagate attacks/viruses to even more computers.</p>\u000a<p>Furthermore, whenever you browse websites such as Facebook, Amazon, or Bank of America, you make the assumption that such sites are safe &#8212; i.e., that no one is going to break into said website and steal your data. Websites are nothing more than more computers, so the same vulnerabilities that exist on your computer probably also exist on those websites.  While there aren&#8217;t really any good ways to guarantee that a given website is following good security practices, it is important to be cognizant of what practices they should be following, so if you discover that they aren&#8217;t, you know to to stop trusting that website.</p>\u000a<h3><span>Install Security Updates</span></h3>\u000a<p>Certain programs run on your computer and &#8220;listen&#8221; on things called &#8220;ports&#8221;.  Imagine a giant building with thousands of doors to the outside.  Most of them are closed and bolted shut, but a few of them have employees guarding them.  Some employees are more alert than others, and some are more gullible than others.  This building is like your computer, the ports are the doors, and the programs are the employees.  Just as it is possible trick an employee into letting a thief inside, it is possible to &#8220;trick&#8221; programs into giving an attacker access to your computer.</p>\u000a<p>If you were the owner of such a building, you would make sure to keep your employees up-to-date on the sorts of people that try to get into your building, and what sort of lines they might use to get themselves in the door.  Likewise, as the owner of your computer, you should always make sure you have the latest updates &#8212; even if it means you have to reboot your computer, you should install them as soon as you can.  Update managers generally have an option to automatically download and install such updates; you should always turn this option on.  (Shameless plug: Linux users can avoid the need to reboot after such security updates by installing <a href="http://www.ksplice.com/">Ksplice</a>!)</p>\u000a<h3><span>Use Common Sense</span></h3>\u000a<p>All of us who have used a computer have probably, at some point, somehow gotten a virus or spyware.  As much as we would like to curse the makers of such software, it is undeniable that the majority of such software on our computers is <em>our fault</em>.  That&#8217;s right &#8212; nearly every piece of malicious software on your computer is there because at some point, you installed a sketchy program or opened an executable attachment in your email.  There are some viruses which propagate due to security holes (see the previous section), but for the most part, they spread because of human error.</p>\u000a<p>So, what do you do?  Your first line of defense is common sense.  What program are you installing?  Is it something written by an unreputable party?  Does it lack a user base?  It the program to be used for dubious purposes?  If the answer to any of these questions is yes, then the chances of the program being malicious is much higher than normal.  Do <em>not</em> install it unless you can verify that it is harmless.  If you are dealing with an email attachment, look at the email.  Is it from a stranger?  If it&#8217;s from someone you know, is it out-of-the-ordinary?  Is it an executable?  Again, if the answer to any of these questions is yes, do <em>not</em> open the attachment.</p>\u000a<p>Of course, none of us are perfect.  Occasionally, we make mistakes.  So, it is always a good idea to have a form of backup protection: anti-virus and anti-spyware programs should catch whatever you miss.  However, they are not perfect either, and don&#8217;t instantaneously have the most recent updates about which viruses are out there.  It is up to you to use common sense to throw out the majority of unscrupulous software that is presented to you.</p>\u000a<h3><span>Protect Your Data</span></h3>\u000a<p>Ben Bitdiddle keeps a note tacked to the corkboard next to his front door which has the location of and combination to his safe.  He also hangs his keys there.  If Eve were to break into Ben&#8217;s house, she wouldn&#8217;t have any trouble at all taking the money, because she would have instant access to where the data is kept and how to access it.  You might say that Ben is pretty stupid for leaving such sensitive information in such an obvious place, and you&#8217;d be right.</p>\u000a<p>Likewise, it is a bad idea to leave a list of passwords lying around.  Many people keep a digital list on their desktop, or write the passwords down and tape them nearby.  Any attacker who gets access to such computers would then have instant access to those accounts, and probably also instant access to your credit card numbers, social security numbers, phone numbers, etc.  &#8220;Ok,&#8221; you say. &#8220;I&#8217;ll hide them somewhere!&#8221;  This is also not a good idea.  Hiding sensitive information, also known as &#8220;security through obscurity&#8221;, is not real security.  If and when an attacker finds the hidden data, they will still have access to all of your personal information.  Security through obscurity can add an extra hurdle, but it is <em>never</em> sufficient to fully protect you.  Such protection only comes through encryption.</p>\u000a<p>Encryption is a way of coding data such that no one can read it unless they have the means to decrypt it (which generally entails having the correct password or key).  Any code counts as encryption, even pig latin &#8212; but you wouldn&#8217;t want to use pig latin to protect your data.  These days, sophisticated algorithms exist that are practically uncrackable (not entirely, but very difficult and time-consuming to do).</p>\u000a<p>You should use a plugin for your browser, such as LastPass or RoboForm, that will automatically generate unique passwords for every single site you visit, and encrypt them locally.  You can then sync the encrypted passwords between all of your computers, so you always have access to your websites.  All you need to remember is a single master password.  This adds a great deal of security because:</p>\u000a<ul>\u000a<li> You have a different password for every single site.  If somebody finds your password to one site, it doesn&#8217;t tell them anything about your other passwords.</li>\u000a<li> All of your passwords (except the master) are encrypted locally before being sent to the server, so even if somebody breaks into the server, they will be unable to view your passwords.</li>\u000a</ul>\u000a<p>But remember &#8212; <em>never, ever give your master password out or write it down</em>.  The only place it should exist is in your head.</p>\u000a<h3><span>What to Take Away</span></h3>\u000a<p>In general, the most important rule of thumb for computer security is to use common sense, as we have seen in this post, and as we will see in the next few posts as well.  A few good guidelines to follow are:</p>\u000a<ul>\u000a<li>Do use common sense.</li>\u000a<li>Do take security updates as soon as possible.</li>\u000a<li>Don&#8217;t install sketchy programs.</li>\u000a<li>Don&#8217;t open sketchy attachments, especially from unknown sources.</li>\u000a<li>Don&#8217;t store all your passwords (and other sensitive information) in a plaintext file.</li>\u000a<li>Do encrypt your passwords and other sensitive information.</li>\u000a<li>Don&#8217;t use the same password for every service.</li>\u000a</ul>\u000a<p>Next time, I&#8217;ll be discussing man-in-the-middle-attacks.  Stay tuned!</p>

V<p>This morning, I read a <a href="http://www.stubbornella.org/content/2010/07/26/woman-in-technology/">blog post</a> about women in computer science which was quite compelling. It reminded me, of course, of <a href="http://valerieaurora.org/howto.html">another article</a> about women in CS, and I began thinking about about what my own opinion is on the subject. Sexism in CS and similarly technical fields is certainly a problem. But why? And how have I encountered it?</p>\u000a<p>It struck me that I am incredibly lucky to be a student at MIT, where I have never actually encountered blatant sexism. No one has ever groped me, or told me I was incompetent because I was a woman (nor have I ever felt that was the case). I was elected SIPB Chair, but it was not that people thought I was sexy or that I slept with anyone, but that I was the right person for the job. When I ask more experienced hackers technical questions, they don&#8217;t try to dumb it down or tell me that I won&#8217;t understand &#8212; they explain it the same way they would to anyone else. Really, I couldn&#8217;t ask for a better environment.</p>\u000a<p>However, it still didn&#8217;t feel quite like sexism (or something like it) it was entirely absent. After thinking a while longer, I realized what the problem was:</p>\u000a<blockquote><p><em>The tech environment walks a fine line between being elitist and being a meritocracy, and often manages to slip back into elitism.</em></p></blockquote>\u000a<p>It&#8217;s not so much a problem of sexism as it is a problem of general attitude. Becoming good at dealing with computers takes a lot of hands-on experience. There aren&#8217;t any classes that will teach you how to debug NetworkManager or how to reconfigure your X configuration so that gdm doesn&#8217;t fail. So those of us who like figuring out the answers to such problems have only a handful of options: 1) learn everything using Google, 2) learn everything by asking an expert, 3) both 1 and 2, or 4) give up. Sometimes, if the problem is specialized enough, 2 and 4 are really the only options. Unfortunately, it is often the case when asking an experienced hacker that they will give a harsh, unhelpful, and/or elitist response. Here&#8217;s an example.</p>\u000a<blockquote><p><strong>Person A:</strong> I need to reinstall this computer with Debian, but I don&#8217;t have a CD or DVD burner or any flash media. I&#8217;m not sure if I have any other options. Could you help me?<br />\u000a<strong>Person B:</strong> I don&#8217;t have time. Just use PXE.</p>\u000a<p><strong>A </strong>(thinking)<strong>:</strong> <em>PXE, what&#8217;s that? I guess I&#8217;ll Google it. Hmm, well, Wikipedia says it&#8217;s a way of booting your computer over the network. I guess sort of like a livecd, except over the network? That&#8217;s kind of cool. How do I do it? <a href="http://www.kegel.com/linux/pxe.html">This site</a> seems to give some links. Looks like the Debian link is broken, so I&#8217;ll use the Red Hat link and see if I can just change the relevant things.</em></p>\u000a<p>[an hour passes]</p>\u000a<p><strong>A</strong> (frustrated)<strong>:</strong> This isn&#8217;t working. How am I supposed to install my computer over the internet if I have to install stuff to the computer to begin with? I don&#8217;t understand how this works!<br />\u000a<strong>B:</strong> &#8230; what the hell are you doing? You just choose the &#8220;netboot&#8221; option in your BIOS, like you would choose to boot from CD-ROM or hard drive, etc.</p></blockquote>\u000a<p>Do you see what Person B did wrong, here? Person A was asking for help, and clearly does not know about netbooting (or they wouldn&#8217;t have asked). Person B assumes they know what PXE is and that they know how to use it, or at least that they can figure it out for themselves. Unfortunately, the documentation on PXE is unhelpful and misleading and never mentions needing to change a setting in your BIOS. Person A tried to figure it out themselves using the vague information given to them by Person B, but only managed to waste an hour and become even more confused! Furthermore, when Person A comes back for more help, Person B acts like they are an idiot for being ignorant and confused, and treats them with disdain. <em>It would have been so much nicer, faster, and easier for Person B to simply say in the first place &#8220;try using the netboot option in your BIOS to boot into the installer over the internet&#8221;.</em></p>\u000a<p>In my experience, the sort of attitude taken by Person B, either intentionally or unintentionally, is the most formidable obstacle facing new tech-oriented people. In particular, I have noticed that men tend to be better at muscling their way through this &#8220;barrier of newbie shame&#8221;. Many studies have shown that women tend to be less confident and less assertive than men, and when the environment is such that you <em>have</em> to be assertive and confident in order to get anywhere, it is no wonder that many choose to give up and choose a different path. Being ignorant does not make you dumb, but many people in CS act like it does.</p>\u000a<p><em>There is no reason why the tech environment should be so elitist.</em> I heartily agree that it must retain a degree of meritocracy: you need to earn your respect as a hacker. However, everyone has to start somewhere; no one is born with awesome hacking abilities, and not everybody is as able to figure out how things work without a few pointers. Wouldn&#8217;t it be so much better to have more skilled people in computer science, to fix even more bugs and create even more brilliant pieces of software? I believe that if we could tone down the elitism, such a world would become a reality.</p>\u000a<p>Unfortunately, it&#8217;s not as easy as just recognizing what the problem is. Being elitist is not always a conscious or deliberate action (most people are not so much of an ass to say &#8220;I won&#8217;t be helpful because I am better than you&#8221;) &#8212; it is usually just the easy way out. Becoming a hacker in an elitist environment makes it all too simple to just assume that that is the correct way of doing things. It is easy to fall into the mindset of &#8220;I had to deal with and stand up to that sort of bullshit when I was new, so why shouldn&#8217;t everyone else?&#8221;. It is easy to find yourself too busy to really help, so you just brush them off with a short, unhelpful answer or tell them to RTFM. It is easy to forget that you were once the confused, ignorant newbie who didn&#8217;t have the background that you now do.</p>\u000a<p>In addition, I think that many people become rough and abrasive because they are all too often asked to <em>fix things themselves</em> as opposed to <em>giving advice</em>. Every tech person is all too familiar with friends, relatives, and acquaintances asking them to fix computers or install software, and most tech people I know hate it. It is especially frustrating when people who are nominally technically competent ask you to do things for them. The urge to say &#8220;no, go figure it out yourself!&#8221; is extremely strong, and it is easy to lump favor-seekers into the same category as advice-seekers. But it is important to make the distinction, and to actually be helpful when someone asks for advice.</p>\u000a<p>So, how can we fix this problem? Recognizing that it is a problem is a first step, but it is not enough. Changing things will not be quick or easy, either. But, there are a few things we can try:</p>\u000a<ol>\u000a<li>If you are too busy to help, politely say so and apologize that you don&#8217;t have the time. Don&#8217;t give vague or cryptic answers.</li>\u000a<li>Don&#8217;t assume that they have the same background of knowledge that you do, because they probably don&#8217;t. Try to explain things at their level. That doesn&#8217;t mean &#8220;dumb it down&#8221;, but &#8220;make sure to include relevant pieces of knowledge that you have but they don&#8217;t&#8221;.</li>\u000a<li>Point them towards documentation which you know is helpful, instead of just throwing terminology around.</li>\u000a<li>Be polite, even if they are asking what seems like a dumb question or asking you to do something for them. You can say &#8220;no, that&#8217;s not my job&#8221; or &#8220;no, I don&#8217;t have time right now&#8221; without being rude and abrasive.</li>\u000a</ol>\u000a<p>From now on, I will try to point out this phenomenon of elitism to people I know in CS, and encourage them to be more conscientious of their interactions with aspiring hackers. I hope that you will, too! I&#8217;d also love to hear any other opinions on this matter. Have you encountered this elitist environment elsewhere? How have you dealt with it?</p>

V<h2><span>Introduction</span></h2>\u000a<p>This is the first post in a series of blog posts about computer security:</p>\u000a<ul>\u000a<li><a href="http://jhamrick.mit.edu/2010/07/07/what-is-computer-security-and-why-should-i-care-part-1/">Part 1 &#8211; Introduction</a></li>\u000a<li><a href="http://jhamrick.mit.edu/2010/08/04/what-is-computer-security-and-why-should-i-care-part-2/">Part 2 &#8211; Hacking Websites and Computers</a></li>\u000a<li>Part 3 &#8211; Man-in-the-Middle Attacks</li>\u000a<li>Part 4 &#8211; Router Hacking</li>\u000a<li>Part 5 &#8211; Internet and Wireless Connection Snooping</li>\u000a</ul>\u000a<p>With computers and technology taking up such a large portion of our everyday lives, you would expect security to be rock-solid, or at least nearly so. Unfortunately, you would be mistaken. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/06/business/06road.html?src=busln">Credit card fraud</a> is all too easy for even a novice, <a href="http://www.us-cert.gov/cas/tips/ST04-014.html">phishing</a> scams trick people into revealing passwords, credit card numbers, or worse, and <a href="http://mobile.darkreading.com/9287/show/70bccd37f24ee7581a6be43ea0c72e54/">fake accounts</a> lead people to trust non-existent or even stolen identities. Those examples only just scratch the surface. If you want to be safe on the internet and on your computer, you need to be savvy about it. Knowledge is power, and with knowledge, you can protect yourself.</p>\u000a<p>Let&#8217;s begin with an analogy. Our main actor, Louis Reasoner, has asked his cousin, Ben Bitdiddle, to send him $1000 in cash through the postal service (Ben owes Louis some money he lent him to buy a new computer). Well, sending cash through the mail isn&#8217;t very smart, but we&#8217;ll ignore that for a moment. So, there are five phases of the money&#8217;s journey:</p>\u000a<ol>\u000a<li>At Ben&#8217;s house</li>\u000a<li>In transit, from Ben&#8217;s house to the post office</li>\u000a<li>At the post office</li>\u000a<li>In transit, from the post office to Louis&#8217; house</li>\u000a<li>At Louis&#8217; house</li>\u000a</ol>\u000a<p>Unfortunately for Louis, his ex-girlfriend, Eve S. Dropper, has heard about the exchange and has decided that she wants the money (for various vengeful reasons, she believes that Louis owes it to her). Eve makes up her mind to somehow steal the money from Louis. How can she do it? Well, she has five opportunities, corresponding to the five stages above:</p>\u000a<ol>\u000a<li>She could break into Ben&#8217;s house and steal the money before he sends it</li>\u000a<li>She could waylay the postman and steal it from him, or she could pretend to be the postman</li>\u000a<li>She could break into the post office and steal it</li>\u000a<li>Same as #2 (except in transit to Louis&#8217; house)</li>\u000a<li>Same as #1 (except at Louis&#8217; house)</li>\u000a</ol>\u000a<p>Malicious hackers know of similar attacks in the realm of computers. Instead of Louis&#8217; house, the route to the post office, the post office, the route to Ben&#8217;s house, and Ben&#8217;s house, the computer analog might consist of your computer, your wireless network, your wireless router, the internet, and a website. Just as one might intercept a letter in the mail, one can intercept the data you send on the internet:</p>\u000a<ol>\u000a<li>Someone could hack into the website and steal the data</li>\u000a<li>Someone could &#8220;reroute&#8221; your connection and pretend to be the website, or they could listen in on your connection to the website</li>\u000a<li>Someone could hack into your router and reconfigure it</li>\u000a<li>Someone could listen in on your wireless network and steal the data</li>\u000a<li>Someone could hack into your computer and steal the data</li>\u000a</ol>\u000a<p>The most common attacks that take place over the internet these days fall into the categories of 1 and 4, but you should be aware and protected against all of them. In the next few posts, we&#8217;ll see how these attacks work, and how you can defend yourself from them.</p>

V<div>\u000a<p>While I was home in VA this past week, my mom and I schemed and decided that I should buy a new camera.  I&#8217;ve been wanting to get a DSLR for a while now, and I&#8217;ll actually be able to afford it with my UROP this summer.  So, I purchased a Canon Rebel T1i, which also happened to come with two lenses:  the 18-55mm, and the 55-250mm.  The 18-55mm is not too bad for a starting lens, although I&#8217;d really love to get my hands on a 50mm f/1.8 or f/1.6.  The 55-250mm seems to be a relatively good quality telephoto, so at this point I&#8217;ve pretty much got all my bases covered, until I can afford more expensive glass.</p>\u000a<p>Anyway, the camera arrived on Friday, which also happened to be pika&#8217;s Faculty Dinner (where we invite a bunch of professors to come eat food with us).  I seized the opportunity and spent the night shooting about 16GB of photos.  Here are a few of my favorites!  You can find the rest <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/jessica.b.hamrick/20100528PikaFacultyDinner">here</a>.</p>\u000a<div class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img title="Kyle and Jess" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_JLjHO7vyf-I/TAMPaH8e-9I/AAAAAAAAUbw/cH9kYMAPWC0/IMG_0646.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="336" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Kyle and Jess</p></div>\u000a<div class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img title="Spang Making Pasta" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_JLjHO7vyf-I/TAMNc9SabaI/AAAAAAAAUdg/gtmxyB874os/s720/IMG_0154.jpg" alt="" width="432" height="383" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Spang Making Pasta</p></div>\u000a<div class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img title="Kyle Has Green Eyes" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_JLjHO7vyf-I/TAMN1ugtjqI/AAAAAAAAUgY/4zLNKGpsHNc/s912/IMG_0254.jpg" alt="" width="547" height="365" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Kyle Has Green Eyes</p></div>\u000a<div class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img title="Amusing Conversations" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_JLjHO7vyf-I/TAMOrWCkg-I/AAAAAAAAUXc/YTEsViqJCZw/IMG_0526.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="320" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Amusing Conversations</p></div>\u000a<div class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img title="Ian" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_JLjHO7vyf-I/TAMPeb8-jZI/AAAAAAAAUcM/k2XyGtFn7YY/s720/IMG_0657.jpg" alt="" width="432" height="366" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Ian</p></div>\u000a</div>
