So! I have multiple computers, and they don't all have the same config files,
oddly enough. There is one folder for each computer, and a folder for shared
config files.

My machines are:
 Ellis: My trustworth piece-of-crap desktop/mail-server. Xubuntu 10.4
 Francisco: My MSI Wind. Debian Squeeze
 Hugh: My actual desktop. Now running Gentoo.
 all: uh, this isn't a computer.

On top of this, if you're curious, I've put here a (crappy) ebuild I wrote for
the gutenbach client. The source is currently hosted on a box I have an
account on in California, because there isn't such a link anywhere else, as
far as I know.


Enjoy
