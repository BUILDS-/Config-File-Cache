So! I have multiple computers, and they don't all have the same config files,
oddly enough. There is one folder for each computer, and a folder for shared
config files.

My machines are:
 Ellis: My trustworth piece-of-crap desktop/mail-server. Xubuntu 10.4
 Francisco: My MSI Wind. Debian Squeeze
 Hugh: My brand new desktop that I built last Monday. Debian Squeeze
 all: uh, this isn't a computer.


Enjoy
